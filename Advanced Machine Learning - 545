Advanced Machine Learning - 545

Week 1
----------
Lab 0 - Personal Finance
    Tool to use to find needed salaries for any input of expenses

Week 2
----------
PA 1.1 - Bagging
    See differences between decision trees, bagging decision trees, and random forests

PA 1.2 - Stacking
    Using multiple base models to create a stacking meta model and compare to single models

Lab 1 - FitBit Sleep Score
    Used techniques from PA to create best model to predict sleep score from FitBit data and plot results

Week 3
----------
PA 2.1 - AdaBoosting
    Used to classify penguins from Palamer dataset with a decision tree as the base estimator.

PA 2.2 - XGBoost and Gradient Boosting
    Similar process.

Lab 2 - Boosting to identify risk of heart disease
    Used all three methood and choose best model for this dataset and found important variables.

Week 4
----------
PA 3.1 - Neural networks
    Found a lot of troubles and had to do extra cleaning and tuning to improve results. Found that teh range of prices hurt the model when doing a nn.

lab 3 - Using neural networks to predict binary categorical income levels
    Clean process of how the model and interpret results for classification.
